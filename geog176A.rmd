In the summer of 2020 I took a class GIS course based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## [Building a project website](https://github.com/hopewilcox/hopewilcox.github.io)

- In this assignment we learned the basic requirements to build an R Markdown website.
- Created a GitHub repository to display the course projects.
- Add personalizations to the website in order to make it our own.
